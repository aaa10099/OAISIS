## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to address the problem of low interaction on the present e-commerce websites. Most of the time, users canâ€™t get a real feel for buying things because of the low-quality images on the website and missing information. Our application gives the user access to interact with others in the metaverse. They can play games, interact with human avatars, grab objects, and walk around the shops and restaurants.

### The Platform
Our platform gives users access to a virtual world of entertainment facilities from the comfort of their homes, avoiding the problem of having to go outside. Users can use the car to access the main menu to play the game. When they start playing the game, soft music in the background starts playing. The user can walk on the road or explore the full city. They can visit the shop and grab objects such as cups, food, and other things available there. We have also created the indoor design of the restaurant, where they can grab the real food and then decide to order it online. A normal food delivery website uses images of the food, but our website has interactive 3D food like the real world, which can be grabbed by the user, and they can know about the information from there, like the real world in the virtual world. At the end when the user wants to exit the game they can come back to the car, where there is the main menu and they can exit the game by pressing the exit button.
